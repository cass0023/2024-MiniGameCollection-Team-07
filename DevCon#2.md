# Digital Prototype Development - Maze Runners Mini Game
## Design Rationale 
What do you envision? ​
A fast-paced fun and cooperative mechanic that involves puzzle like and critical problem solving to reach the end goal which is reuniting with the other player moving on to the next maze and continuing before the time runs out which is 60 sec.​
How does this support the overall project/company goal?​
It's a simply designed idea​
Works for the controller specification​
It involves 2 players​
It's in the time limit of 30-60 seconds​

### What is our Mechanic
Teamwork and navigation (ie: there could be a blue door that the second player need to go through but cannot until the first player clicks a button)​

### Design Objective Statement
The idea is to have 2 players travel through a short maze to meet up or connect with each other before the game is over.​
You go into different levels with each successive pass​
Eventually the time will run out and how many levels you completed in 60 sec will be your score​
To get through the maze you must solve mini puzzles (ie: opening a door or breaking a wall)​

What emotional and gameplay goals are you striving for with this design?​
Emotional goals –Fulfillment, Connection,​
Gameplay goals-Fast paced, Intuitive​

Why?​
We want our game to be engaging and grab our players attention while still remaining in the 60 second time limit. By having levels to complete within the timer, it gives replay value to the game inspiring the player to retry and beat their last record. We will have the levels randomly generate each time as well to add more randomness to the game.​
